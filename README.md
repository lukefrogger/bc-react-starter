# Getting Started with BigCommerce React Starter

This is the BigCommerce React Starter, built with the
storfront-data-hooks library and the storefront-ui-components library
to put together a starter storefront.

To install dependencies, run:

```
yarn
```

## Set environment variables

The below environment variables are needed to run the starter:

```
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_TOKEN=
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_CLIENT_ID=
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_HASH=
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_URL=
BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_URL=
BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=
BC_STARTER_SERVER_PORT=3030
REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3030/api
REACT_APP_CART_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3030/cart
```

A few notes:
- `BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_TOKEN`, `BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_CLIENT_ID`, `BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_HASH`, `BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_URL`,
`BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_URL` can all be acquired from bigcommerce
and your developer documentation
- `BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_URL` is the bigcommerce graphql endpoint
- To generate the graphql token: `BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN`, set
  all the other environment variables first, and run `yarn regen`.  This
will generate a graphql token that expires in 24 hrs.
